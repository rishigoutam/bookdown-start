[["index.html", "A Rishi Bookdown Book Preface", " A Rishi Bookdown Book Rishi Goutam 2022-04-24 Preface This is the very first part of the book. I am using RStudio with the bookdown package for creating this book. Sean Kross’s blog article was extremely helpful in getting me to understand how this works with GitHub Pages for automatic hosting. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. However, I am using MacTeX, a more complete TeX package. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (R-bookdown?) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

For bold text, use two underscores (text) or asterisks (text). Text surrounded by ~ will be converted to a subscript (e.g., H2SO4 renders H2SO4), and similarly, two carets (^) produce a superscript (e.g., Fe2+ renders Fe2+). To mark text as inline code, use a pair of backticks, e.g., code.3 Small caps can be produced by the HTML tag span, e.g., Small Caps renders Small Caps. Links are created using text, e.g., RStudio. Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret 1, e.g., 2. Blockquotes are possible “Rishi likes blockquotes a lot. If anyone thinks blockquotes are useless, they are incorrect and should rethink their priorities and go do something else — “Rishi Goutam” This is a code block with no language specified at all This is also a code block 2.2 Headers 2.2.1 H3 2.2.1.1 H4 2.2.1.1.1 You should really not use H5s… This header is not numbered 2.3 Math \\[e^{\\pi i} + 1 = 0\\] \\[X = \\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; x_{1}\\\\ 1 &amp; x_{2}\\\\ 1 &amp; x_{3} \\end{bmatrix}\\] \\[\\begin{vmatrix}a &amp; b\\\\ c &amp; d \\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc\\] We can number an equation \\[\\begin{equation} e^{\\pi i} + 1 = 0 \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] and refer to it (2.1) 2.4 Special custom blocks Bookdown provides some special handling for custom blocks, such as theorem and example.
