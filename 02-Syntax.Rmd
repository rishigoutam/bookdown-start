# Syntax

## Basic

You can make text italic by surrounding it with underscores or asterisks, e.g., _text_ or *text*. For bold text, use two underscores (__text__) or asterisks (**text**). Text surrounded by ~ will be converted to a subscript (e.g., H~2~SO~4~ renders H2SO4), and similarly, two carets (^) produce a superscript (e.g., Fe^2+^ renders Fe2+). To mark text as inline code, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `code`.3 Small caps can be produced by the HTML tag span, e.g., <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span> renders Small Caps. Links are created using [text](link), e.g., [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[], e.g., ^[This is a footnote.]. 

Blockquotes are possible

> "Rishi likes blockquotes a lot. If anyone thinks blockquotes 
are useless, they are incorrect and should rethink their priorities
and go do something else

## Headers

### H3

#### H4

##### You should really not use H5s...

## This header is not numbered {-}

## Math
$$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0$$
$$X = \begin{bmatrix}1 & x_{1}\\
1 & x_{2}\\
1 & x_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$$

$$\begin{vmatrix}a & b\\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$

We can number an equation
\begin{equation}
  e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0
  (\#eq:epi)
\end{equation}

and refer to it \@ref(eq:epi)

## Special custom blocks

Bookdown provides some special handling for custom blocks, such as `theorem` and `example`. See [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html#theorems) for the full list

::: {.theorem #pyth name="Pythagorean theorem"}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse
and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::

We can refer to a named `theorem`. Remember trig theorem \@ref(thm:pyth)

## Tables

We can have tables

```{r table-single, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(mtcars[, 1:8], 10), booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'A table of the first 10 rows of the mtcars data.'
)
```

```{r iris, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  list(
    head(iris[, 1:2], 3),
    head(mtcars[, 1:3], 5)
  ),
  caption = 'A Tale of Two Tables.', booktabs = TRUE
)
```


## Figures {#figures}


```{r cars-plot, out.width='70%', fig.cap='A figure example with a relative width 70\\%.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
```


```{r memoji, out.width='32.8%', fig.cap='Memoji of Rishi Goutam'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('memoji.png'))
```


## HTML Widgets

See [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)

We can also use JavaScript libraries for rich data visualizations. Install the below for outputting to non-HTML files.

```
install.packages("webshot")
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```

We use the DT package to show the iris dataset:

```{r DT-demo, fig.cap='A table widget rendered via the DT package.'}
DT::datatable(iris)
```
